        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <div class="about-copy">
          <p>We are a group of friends and dedicated One Piece Trading Card Game collectors based in Malaysia and Singapore, specializing in rare collectibles, vintage cards, tournament prize cards, and premium grails. While One Piece is our primary focus, we occasionally list cards and collectibles from other TCGs from our personal collections as well.</p>

          <p>Please note that we do not operate a physical storefront and are not accepting consignment items at this time.</p>

          <p>While we strive to keep our Facebook/Carousell posts up to date, pricing and availability may occasionally change. In the event of any discrepancy, please refer to our listings here for the latest information.</p>
